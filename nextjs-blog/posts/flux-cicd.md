Flux CD is an open-source tool that facilitates continuous delivery of Kubernetes manifests. This documentation provides an overview of its features and how it can be utilized effectively.

## Introduction
Flux CD automates the deployment and management of infrastructure configurations in a Kubernetes cluster. It follows a declarative approach and integrates with Git repositories, enabling developers to define and version their Kubernetes manifests alongside their application code.

## Usage

- **Versioning Kubernetes manifests**: Flux CD allows developers to use Git for versioning their infrastructure configurations. Changes made to the manifests are stored in the Git history, providing the ability to track and revert changes when necessary.

- **Automated deployment synchronization**: Flux CD continuously synchronizes the Kubernetes cluster with the configurations defined in the Git repository. Any changes made to the manifests are automatically applied to the cluster, reducing the risk of errors and ensuring consistency.

- **Environment-specific deployments**: Developers can define separate branches or tags for different environments (e.g., development, staging, production) using Flux CD. This facilitates easy management and deployment of specific configurations to each environment.

## Example

Here are some example use cases for Flux CD:

- Version control: Flux CD helps in maintaining version control by storing Kubernetes manifests in a Git repository

- Automated deployment: With Flux CD, deployments are automatically synchronized, eliminating the need for manual intervention and enabling streamlined deployment processes.

- Environment-specific configurations: Flux CD supports separate branches or tags for different environments, allowing developers to manage and deploy configurations specific to each environment.

In summary, Flux CD simplifies and automates the continuous delivery of Kubernetes manifests, making it easier for teams to manage and deploy their infrastructure configurations alongside their application code. By leveraging Git as the source of truth and supporting multiple environments, Flux CD empowers developers to achieve seamless, version-controlled deployments in their Kubernetes clusters.
